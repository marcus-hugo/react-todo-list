# React Todo List App

## Overview

I wanted to test my knowlege of React after completing the '10
Days of React' from Brad Schiff's Udemy course 'React for the Rest of Us'.

Though, I have built a vanilla js todo list app before and prior React learning from Scrimba, I felt like this would be a great
appliction for a React project.

## What I learned! ðŸ’ª

### `props`

They seem pretty straight forward to understand. They are like HTML attributes. I keep reminding myself, that they are
passed down from parent to child components. Also, they can be functions.

### `useState`

This has been one of the harder concepts to grasp.
I feel that with practicing, it is becoming more clear on how it works. With two parameters, the first is the initial state and the second is a function to update that state but not change it's initial value.

### `useEffect`

This will take in two parameters, with the first a callback function and the second the state. So when the state is updated the function will run. In this app it's used to set/update local storage and and state.
