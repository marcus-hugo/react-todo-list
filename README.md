# React Todo List App

## Intro

I wanted to test my knowlege of React after completing the '10
day of React' from Brad Sciff's course 'React for the Rest of Us' on Udemy.

Though I have build a vanilla js todo list app and prior React learning from Scrimba, I felt like this would be a great
appliction for a React project.

## What I learned!

### `props`

They seem pretty straight forward to understand. I keep reminding myself that they are
passed down to child components. They can be functions too.

### `useState`

This has been one of the harder concepts to grasp.
I feel that with more practice, it is becoming easier to understand.
