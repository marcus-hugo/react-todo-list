# React Todo List App

## Overview

I wanted to test my knowlege of React after completing the '10
day of React' from Brad Sciff's course 'React for the Rest of Us' on Udemy.

Though I have build a vanilla js todo list app and prior React learning from Scrimba, I felt like this would be a great
appliction for a React project.

## What I learned! ðŸ’ª

### `props`

They seem pretty straight forward to understand. They are like html attributes. I keep reminding myself that they are
passed down from parent to child components. They can be functions also.

### `useState`

This has been one of the harder concepts to grasp.
I feel that with more practice, it is becoming more clear on how it works. With two parameters, the first is the initial state and the second is a function to update that state but not change it's initial value.

### `useEffect`

This will take in two parameters with the first a callback function and the second the state. So when the state is updated the function will run. In this app it's used to set/update local storage and and state.
